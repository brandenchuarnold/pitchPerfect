Hinge Dating App Automation Bot - Development Outline

Current Implementation:

1. Profile Processing Flow:
   - Target Interactions:
     * Random target between 4-6 successful interactions
     * Resets after reaching target
     * Dislikes profile when target reached
   
   - Profile Analysis:
     * Takes 6 screenshots while scrolling down
     * Processes screenshots with AI in separate thread
     * Scrolls back to top while AI processes
     * Waits for AI response
   
   - Profile Filtering:
     * Dislikes if AI returns empty response
     * Dislikes if prompt match confidence < 0.8
     * Dislikes if prompt not found after 3 attempts

2. Screenshot Capture:
   - Takes 6 screenshots total
   - Uses consistent 68% scroll distance
   - Captures full profile content
   - Saves as profile_{count}_part{i}.png
   - Includes visualization overlays for debugging

3. AI Integration:
   - System Prompt:
     * Profile structure guide
     * Analysis requirements
     * Response generation rules
   
   - Response Processing:
     * Returns JSON with:
       - prompt: Exact prompt text
       - response: User's response
       - conversation_starter: Generated response
       - screenshot_index: Location of prompt
   
   - Prompt Matching:
     * Matches against authoritative prompts.txt
     * Requires 0.8 confidence threshold
     * Uses fuzzy matching for flexibility

4. Prompt Location and Response:
   - Location Strategy:
     * Scrolls to target screenshot
     * Three attempts to find prompt:
       1. On target screenshot
       2. One screen up
       3. Back on target screenshot
     * Falls back to bottom if all attempts fail
   
   - Response Flow:
     * Finds "Add a comment" box
     * Types response with proper timing
     * Closes keyboard
     * Finds "Send Priority Like" button
     * Clicks to send response

5. Error Handling:
   - Profile Filtering:
     * Empty AI responses
     * Low confidence prompt matches
     * Failed prompt location
     * Failed response sending
   
   - Recovery Actions:
     * Dislikes profile on failure
     * Moves to next profile
     * Maintains interaction counter

6. Debugging and Visualization:
   - Screenshot Analysis:
     * Text box detection
     * Line and paragraph grouping
     * Visual overlays for debugging
   
   - Logging:
     * Scroll positions
     * Match confidence scores
     * Success/failure states
     * Interaction counts

Future Improvements:
1. Adaptive Timing:
   - Device performance based delays
   - Dynamic scroll parameters
   
2. Enhanced Detection:
   - Keyboard state detection
   - Screen layout adaptation
   - Edge case handling
   
3. Performance Optimization:
   - Screenshot quality verification
   - Scroll parameter optimization
   - Resource management
