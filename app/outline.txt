Hinge Dating App Automation Bot - Development Outline

Current Focus:
- Monetize

1. Profile Loading and Initial Screenshot Capture:
   Goals:
   - Load the profile
   - Take full-screen screenshots while scrolling
   - Ensure complete profile coverage

   Currently Implemented:
   1. Profile Loading:
      * Connect to device via ADB
      * Get screen resolution
      * Calculate scroll parameters
   
   2. Screenshot Capture:
      * Initial screenshot at top
      * 8 scrolls with screenshots
      * Save as profile_{count}_part{i}.png
      * Bottom detection using UiScrollable:
        - Check position after each screenshot
        - Stop capture when bottom reached
        - Log bottom detection events
        - Fallback to screenshot comparison if needed

   Left to Do:
   - Implement adaptive timing based on device performance
   - Add screenshot quality verification
   - Optimize scroll parameters for different screen sizes

2. Joke Generation and Visual Analysis:
   Goals:
   - Process screenshots and context files for joke generation
   - Analyze screenshots to locate prompt positions
   - Calculate precise tap coordinates
   - Ensure contextual relevance using provided databases

   Currently Implemented:
   1. Context Files:
      * format.txt: Profile structure guide
      * prompts.txt: Available prompts database
      * captions.txt: Photo captions database
   
   2. AI Integration:
      * System prompt with structural information
      * User prompt for specific analysis
      * Visual analysis of screenshots:
        - Treat screenshots as phone screen view
        - Measure text box positions relative to image height
        - Calculate absolute coordinates based on device height (2400)
        - Validate coordinate calculations
      * Returns JSON with prompt, response, and coordinates
      * Confidence scoring for matches
      * Prompt database matching:
        - Load all prompts from prompts.txt
        - Use fuzzy matching to find best match for AI-generated prompt
        - Replace AI prompt with exact database match

   Expected Output Structure:
   {
     "prompt": "The exact prompt text to match",
     "response": "The user's response to the prompt",
     "joke": "The generated joke",
     "screenshot_index": "Index of the screenshot containing the prompt",
     "coordinates": {
       "x": "Absolute x coordinate based on device width",
       "y": "Absolute y coordinate based on device height (2400)",
       "relative_position": "Percentage from top of image (0-100)",
       "confidence": "Confidence score of coordinate calculation"
     }
   }

3. Prompt Location and Response:
   Goals:
   - Navigate to the correct screenshot
   - Click on the prompt location using calculated coordinates
   - Prepare for response input

   Currently Implemented:
   1. Screenshot Navigation:
      * Scroll to top of profile
      * Scroll down to target screenshot index
      * Use consistent scroll parameters
      * Wait for scroll completion
   
   2. Prompt Interaction:
      * Double-click at calculated coordinates
      * Wait for prompt to open
      * Verify prompt is ready for input

   Left to Do:
   - Add scroll position verification
   - Implement scroll retry mechanism
   - Add coordinate validation
   - Handle edge cases for prompt location
   - Implement coordinate adjustment for different screen resolutions

4. Keyboard Interaction and Response:
   Goals:
   - Open keyboard for text input
   - Type response with proper timing
   - Close keyboard after input
   - Find and click priority like button
   - Handle different screen layouts

   Currently Implemented:
   1. Text Input:
      * Character-by-character typing with delay
      * Space character handling
      * Basic keyboard interaction
   
   2. Response Location:
      * Wait for keyboard to appear
      * Type response with proper timing
      * Handle keyboard layout changes

   Left to Do:
   - Implement keyboard detection:
     * Check if keyboard is open
     * Wait for keyboard to fully appear
     * Handle different keyboard layouts
   - Add keyboard closing mechanism:
     * Detect when response is complete
     * Close keyboard programmatically
     * Verify keyboard is closed
   - Priority Like Button:
     * Find button location based on prompt length
     * Handle different screen positions
     * Click with proper timing
   - Screen Space Management:
     * Calculate safe areas with keyboard open
     * Adjust scroll positions accordingly
     * Handle obscured UI elements

5. Error Handling:
   Goals:
   - Recover from failed operations
   - Maintain bot operation
   - Track and report issues

   Currently Implemented:
   1. Basic Error Handling:
      * API error handling
      * Input verification
      * Fallback mechanisms for no matches
   
   2. Recovery:
      * Retry mechanisms for text input
      * Profile skipping on critical failures
      * State management for profile processing

   Left to Do:
   - Implement comprehensive logging system
   - Add detailed error recovery strategies
   - Handle keyboard interaction failures
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Add coordinate calculation validation
   - Implement fallback for failed coordinate calculations
