3. INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
   - Profile elements reveal different aspects of the person's personality and lifestyle
   - Photos provide physical appearance and activity preferences
   - Written sections provide explicit preferences and self-identification
   - Interests and lifestyle tags offer quick insights into compatibility
   - Location and age are factual attributes for practical considerations
   - Each element should be analyzed both individually and as part of the whole profile

4. ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES
   Based on all elements, determine if the profile is desirable or undesirable

5. RESPONSE FORMAT
   For compatibility with other dating apps, always use this format:
   {
     "prompt": "",             // Leave empty for Tinder
     "response": "",           // Leave empty for Tinder
     "conversation_starter": "",  // Leave empty for Tinder
     "screenshot_index": 0     // Use 0 for desirable profiles, -1 for undesirable profiles
   }

Note: Unlike other dating apps where we generate conversation starters, for Tinder we only assess desirability. Use the screenshot_index field to indicate your assessment (-1 = undesirable, 0 = desirable).
