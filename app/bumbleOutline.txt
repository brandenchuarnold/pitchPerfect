Bumble Dating App Automation Bot - Development Outline

Current Implementation:

1. Profile Processing Flow:
   - Profile Limit:
     * Maximum of 40 profiles processed
     * Exits gracefully when limit reached
     * Early exit if end of profiles detected
   
   - Early Stopping:
     * Checks for any of these messages before processing each profile:
       - "You've seen everyone for now"
       - "Try changing your filters so more people match your criteria - or check again later!"
       - "Change filters"
       - "Review skipped profiles"
       - "You're out of free likes for today"
       - "You're out of free"
       - "likes for today"
     * Uses OCR with 0.8 similarity threshold
     * Saves screenshot of end message for verification
     * Creates visual debug overlay showing matched text
     * Exits gracefully with specific end message
   
   - Conversation Starter Quota:
     * Maximum of 2 conversation starters per week
     * Resets every Sunday at 6pm Eastern Time
     * Tracks usage in persistent storage
     * Only processes prompt/response if quota is not reached
     * Still evaluates desirability regardless of quota
   
   - Target Interactions:
     * Likes 6-9 consecutive profiles (random target) regardless of undesirable profiles encountered
     * After reaching this target, checks if we've disliked any profile during this run:
       - If we have already disliked at least one profile, continue liking until 9 total likes
       - If we haven't disliked any profile yet, dislike the next profile (even if desirable)
     * Continues until a total of 9 profiles have been liked
     * This guarantees 9 likes and at least 1 dislike per run, with randomized dislike timing
     * Profiles determined undesirable by AI are always disliked regardless of target count
   
   - Profile Analysis:
     * Takes 9 screenshots while scrolling down (initial + 8 scrolls)
     * Processes screenshots with AI in separate thread
     * Scrolls back to top while AI processes
     * Waits for AI response
   
   - Profile Filtering:
     * Dislikes if AI returns empty response
     * Dislikes if screenshot_index = -1 (undesirable profile)
     * AI automatically filters profiles with these undesirable traits:
       - Body Type Analysis:
         · Visible excess weight or body fat
         · Body width appears wider than typical fit/skinny woman
         · Visible stomach protrusion in any photo
         · Face shape is rounder with less defined jawline
         · Only face/high angle photos (hiding body)
       - Low Quality Photos:
         · Majority of photos are blurry/pixelated
         · Heavy filters or editing in majority of photos
         · Screenshots or reposts in multiple photos
       - Male Features:
         · Adam's apple visible in the throat
         · Facial hair (mustache or beard)
         · Flat chest with no boob growth visible
   
   - Results Storage:
     * Saves all profile data in organized directory structure:
       - results/profile_X/screenshots/ - Contains all screenshots
       - results/profile_X/response.json - Contains AI response and timestamp
     * Duplicates results in desktop accessible location:
       - /app/desktop/PitchPerfect_Results_{TIMESTAMP}/profile_X/
     * Saves results for every profile, regardless of outcome
     * Includes timestamp with each response
     * Maintains original screenshot files in images/ directory

2. Screenshot Capture and Analysis:
   - Takes 9 screenshots total (initial + 8 scrolls)
   - Uses consistent 68% scroll distance for reliability
   - Captures full profile content in sequential screenshots
   - Saves as profile_{count}_part{i}.png
   - Creates visualization overlays for debugging
   - Uses OCR with pytesseract to extract text from images
   - Implements visual debug overlays with boxes, lines, and paragraphs
   - Groups text into logical lines and paragraphs based on spatial proximity

3. Prompt Detection Improvements:
   - Enhanced OCR-based text detection with fuzzy matching
   - Multi-step prompt location strategy:
     * Checks initial screenshot for prompt
     * Scrolls up once to look for prompt if not found initially
     * Scrolls back to original position if not found after scrolling up
     * Falls back to center-screen tap if prompt cannot be found
   - Implements visualization for each detection attempt
   - Refactored to use modular helper function for prompt matching logic
   - Sanitizes debug logs to prevent base64 data from cluttering output

4. AI Integration:
   - Bumble-Specific Processing Flow:
     * Evaluates profile desirability based on screenshots
     * Returns JSON response with screenshot_index indicating desirability
     * screenshot_index = -1 for undesirable profiles, ≥ 0 for desirable profiles
     * Does not generate conversation starters in current implementation
     * Uses dedicated function separate from Hinge functionality
   
   - System Prompt:
     * Profile structure guide with 9 screenshots analysis
     * Detailed trait detection for filtering undesirable profiles
     * Focused solely on determining profile desirability
     * Will be expanded in future to include conversation starter generation
   
   - Response Processing:
     * Returns JSON with different formats based on conditions:
       - Undesirable profile:
         · prompt: ""
         · response: ""
         · conversation_starter: ""
         · screenshot_index: -1
       - Desirable profile, no quota available:
         · prompt: ""
         · response: ""
         · conversation_starter: ""
         · screenshot_index: 0
       - Desirable profile, quota available, prompt found:
         · prompt: Exact prompt text
         · response: User's response
         · conversation_starter: Generated conversation starter
         · screenshot_index: Location of prompt (0-7)
       - Desirable profile, quota available, no prompt found:
         · prompt: ""
         · response: ""
         · conversation_starter: ""
         · screenshot_index: 0
     * Handles error cases gracefully

5. Profile Response Flow:
   - Process:
     * Takes 9 screenshots while scrolling through profile
     * Sends screenshots to AI for desirability assessment
     * AI returns JSON with screenshot_index indicating desirability:
       - screenshot_index = -1: Profile is undesirable
       - screenshot_index ≥ 0: Profile is desirable
     * Decision Logic:
       - Always dislike if screenshot_index is -1 (undesirable)
       - For desirable profiles (screenshot_index ≥ 0):
         · Like profiles until reaching randomly chosen target (6-9 likes)
         · After target reached, check if we've disliked any profile in current run
         · If no dislike has occurred yet, dislike this profile (even if desirable)
         · If we've already disliked at least one profile, continue liking
       - Continue process until exactly 9 profiles have been liked total
     * Visually documents each step with debugging overlays
     * Tracks statistics for reporting

6. Quota Management (Reserved for Future Implementation):
   - Currently not implemented as we're not sending compliments
   - Will be used when compliments feature is enabled in the future
   - Planned Implementation:
     * Maximum of 2 conversation starters per week
     * Will reset every Sunday at 6pm Eastern Time
     * Will track usage in persistent storage
     * Will only process prompt/response if quota is not reached

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Comprehensive logging:
     * Detailed debug logging to file with timestamps
     * Console output for important events
     * Visual overlays saved for debugging
     * Sanitized API payloads to prevent log clutter
   
   - Error recovery:
     * Try-except blocks throughout the codebase
     * Fallback strategies for most failure points
     * Graceful degradation when optimal path fails
     * Detailed error logging with tracebacks at debug level
   
   - Profile Filtering:
     * Multiple layers of validation
     * Consistent handling of rejection cases
     * Track all like/dislike actions for reporting

8. Multithreading:
   - Parallel processing:
     * Screenshot capture and scrolling in main thread
     * AI processing in background thread
     * Thread synchronization with join()
     * Thread-safe global variable access with locks
     * Efficient use of waiting time during AI processing

9. Configuration:
   - Environment variables for device connection
   - Random targeting for interaction counts
   - Timestamp-based result directories
   - Authoritative reference files:
     * bumbleFormat.txt - Profile structure information
     * bumblePrompts.txt - Available Bumble statements/prompts
     * bumbleMetadata.txt - Profile attribute categories and options
     * bumbleCauses.txt - List of possible causes and communities
     * bumbleInterests.txt - Available interest options 

TODO:
1. Update the AI system prompt with the new conversation starter guidelines
   - Implement the expanded examples of good vs. bad conversation starters
   - Incorporate the updated guidance on natural language and brevity
   - Add the section on avoiding marketing-style language
2. Begin Bumble development phase
   - Test the updated AI prompt with real profiles
   - Verify "Send Like" button detection is working correctly
   - Monitor conversation starter quality with new guidelines 

FUTURE WORK:
1. Prompt Matching Implementation:
   - Matches against authoritative bumblePrompts.txt
   - Requires 0.8 confidence threshold
   - Uses fuzzy matching with similarity ratio calculation
   - Logs all potential matches for debugging
   - Reports best match with confidence score

2. Prompt Location and Response Implementation:
   - Location Strategy:
     * Scrolls to target screenshot indicated by AI
     * Three attempts to find prompt:
       1. On target screenshot
       2. One screen up from target
       3. Back on target screenshot after scrolling down
     * Additional scroll-up-and-check in the OCR detection phase
     * Falls back to bottom-of-profile approach if all attempts fail
   
   - Response Flow:
     * Locates the heart button below the prompt/statement
     * Heart button is aligned with the left edge of the prompt
     * Fixed Y distance below the end of the prompt text
     * Taps heart button to open "Send a Compliment" interface
     * Types AI-generated conversation starter
     * Closes keyboard using back key
     * Finds "Send" button using OCR
     * Clicks to send response
     * Visually documents each step with debugging overlays
     * Updates conversation starter quota
