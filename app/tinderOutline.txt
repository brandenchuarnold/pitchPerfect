Tinder Dating App Automation Bot - Development Outline

Current Implementation:

1. Profile Processing Flow:
   - Early Stopping:
     * Uses the same end message detection as other apps
     * Uses OCR with 0.8 similarity threshold
     * Saves screenshot of end message for verification
     * Creates visual debug overlay showing matched text
     * Exits gracefully with specific end message
   
   - Target Interactions:
     * Like profiles while disliking undesirables based on AI evaluation
     * If 6-9 consecutive likes occur without any dislikes, force dislike on the next profile
     * Continue liking until reaching a total of 9 likes
     * After reaching 9 likes, reset all counters (consecutive likes, total likes, dislikes)
     * For forced dislikes, still capture and save screenshots without AI evaluation
   
   - Profile Analysis:
     * Takes 9 screenshots while scrolling through photos
     * For forced dislikes, still captures screenshots and saves to desktop
     * For normal profiles, processes screenshots with AI in separate thread
     * Stays at the last screenshot of the profile while AI processes
     * Waits for AI response
   
   - Profile Filtering:
     * Dislikes if AI returns empty response
     * Dislikes if desirability assessment is "undesirable"
        - Dislike button coordinates (X): 220x1350
        - Like button coordinates (heart): 500x1350
     * AI automatically filters profiles with undesirable traits
   
   - Results Storage:
     * Saves all profile data in desktop accessible location:
       - /app/desktop/PitchPerfect_Results_Tinder_{TIMESTAMP}/profile_X/
       - Each profile folder contains screenshots and response.json with AI response and timestamp
     * Saves results for every profile, regardless of outcome
     * Includes timestamp with each response
     * Maintains temporarily needed files in images/ directory but doesn't preserve them in workspace

2. Screenshot Capture and Analysis:
   - Takes up to 9 screenshots total (one per photo)
   - Captures using right-to-left swipe on photo for next photo
   - Uses consistent swipe gesture to navigate between photos
   - Monitors for UI indicators to detect last photo
   - Saves as profile_{count}_part{i}.png
   - Creates visualization overlays for debugging
   - Uses OCR with pytesseract to extract text from images
   - Implements visual debug overlays with boxes, lines, and paragraphs
   - Groups text into logical lines and paragraphs based on spatial proximity

3. AI Integration:
   - System Prompt:
     * Profile structure guide with 9 screenshots analysis
     * Detailed trait detection for filtering undesirable profiles
     * Returns JSON with desirable/undesirable classification
   
   - Response Processing:
     * Parses JSON from text response by extracting between first { and last }
     * Returns JSON with desire_analysis
     * Handles empty or error responses gracefully
     * Returns empty response for profiles with undesirable traits

4. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Comprehensive logging:
     * Detailed debug logging to file with timestamps
     * Console output for important events
     * Visual overlays saved for debugging
     * Sanitized API payloads to prevent log clutter
   
   - Error recovery:
     * Try-except blocks throughout the codebase
     * Fallback strategies for most failure points
     * Graceful degradation when optimal path fails
     * Detailed error logging with tracebacks at debug level

5. Multithreading:
   - Parallel processing:
     * Screenshot capture and swiping in main thread
     * AI processing in background thread
     * Thread synchronization with join()
     * Thread-safe global variable access with locks

6. Configuration:
   - Environment variables for device connection
   - Timestamp-based result directories
   - Authoritative reference files:
     * tinderFormat.txt - Profile structure information

TODO:
1. Add advertisement recognition
   - Implement detection for Tinder ads and promotions
   - Create handlers for "Upgrade to Tinder Gold/Plus" popups
   - Develop recognition for "Out of Likes" notification
   - Handle "Match" notifications that may appear
